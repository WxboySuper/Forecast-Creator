# Forecast Creator

**Phase 1 - Project Setup:**
- [ ] Setup GitHub Repository
- [ ] Define Project Scope and Requirements
- [ ] Set up WinUI 3 application with C#
- [ ] Integrate SkiaSharp for drawing on maps

**Phase 2 - Base Map and Drawing Tools:**
- [ ] Implement a CONUS map layer (offline base layer)
- [ ] Add drawing tools (polygons, contours, text, etc.)
- [ ] Save/ load drawn outlooks in a simple format (JSON/XML)
- [ ] Forecast Export Options (PNG, KML, etc.)

**Phase 3 - Weather Dara Integration:**
- [ ] Implement basic radar/satellite data plotting
- [ ] Support NetCDF/GRIB2 data formats for mesoanalysis
- [ ] Add overlay for reports for verification
- [ ] Add overlay customization (opacity, layers, colors)

**Phase 4 - UI Enhancements & Usability:**
- [ ] Create a modern UI with WinUI 3 Controls
- [ ] Add tools for zooming, panning, and selecting areas
- [ ] Implement layer toggling for radar/ satellite/ forecast

**Phase 5 - Offline Support:**
- [ ] Enable local storage of forecast maps and data
- [ ] Implement a file-based system for pre-downloaded weather data
- [ ] Allow manual data import (users load their own GRIB2/NetCDF files)

**Phase 6 - Game(?):**
- [ ] Add a reanalysis game where you make a forecast for an unknown date
- [ ] Points for getting close to tornado reports
- [ ] Create different outlooks based on different levels of data (12z, 1630z, 20z, 01z)
    - [ ] More points for 12z outlooks than 20z or 01z

**Phase 7 - Game Expansion:**
- [ ] Hourly game mode with more data
- [ ] Chase mode???
